Introduction
============

The TIER Access Governance Practicum (401) describes a series of real world
access governance use cases that students can use to demonstrate knowledge
of how to translate natural language policy into the appropriate digital
policy in Grouper. The access governance practicum incorporates much of the
TIER IAM suite of components and provides a “full TIER stack” experience.

The Practicum consists of 4 labs that will allow students to apply knowledge
they have learned from other Grouper courses.  They will present real-world
access control scenarios.  Instructors will present techniques and possible
solutions to these problems.

In the documentation, many references will be made to Grouper groups and
folders (stems).  These references will sometimes take the form of a complete
path to the referenced object, such as `app:vpn:ref:ad_hoc`.  Other times,
the references will be relative to the current context under discussion.
For example, when referring to the same application-specific reference group
for the VPN service, the notation `...:ref:ad_hoc` may be used to indicate that
a portion of the full path has been omitted.
