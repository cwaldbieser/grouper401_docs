Overview
--------

We have been asked to deploy a SaaS application called Board Effect. The
service is already an InCommon member and honors an `eduPersonEntitlement`
for "front door" access. Permission management within the application is
centered around "work rooms".  Each work room provide access to specific
documents, chat, mailing lists, etc.  The system will be used by trustees,
executives, and various committee members.

Thankfully the service is an InCommon member and using `eduPersonEntitlement`
values.  However, it turns out users still need to have accounts provisioned
in order to get access. We will need two different kinds of policy groups.
The first, the account policy group, will be mapped to an `eduPersonEntitlement`
value and also be used for provisioning accounts.  The second type,
authorization groups, will provide subject to role mapping, and are mapped
to work rooms created in Board Effect. This is an example of access control
model 3 described in the `Grouper Deployment Guide`_.

Exercise 401.3.1

*Create a application policy folder and groups*

Rather than create the basic structure manually, use a
:ref:`GSH script <apdx-401.3.1-app-skeleton>`.
