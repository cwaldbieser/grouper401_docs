Overview
--------

We have been asked to deploy a SaaS application called Board Effect. The
service is already an InCommon member and honors an `eduPersonEntitlement`
for "front door" access. Permission management within the application is
centered around "work rooms".  Each work room provide access to specific
documents, chat, mailing lists, etc.  The system will be used by trustees,
executives, and various committee members.

Thankfully the service is an InCommon member and using `eduPersonEntitlement`
values.  However, it turns out users still need to have accounts provisioned
in order to get access. We will need two different kinds of policy groups.
The first, the account policy group, will be mapped to an `eduPersonEntitlement`
value and also be used for provisioning accounts.  The second type,
authorization groups, will provide subject to role mapping, and are mapped
to work rooms created in Board Effect. This is an example of access control
model 3 described in the `Grouper Deployment Guide`_.

----------------
Exercise 401.3.1
----------------

*Create a application policy folder and groups*

Rather than create the basic structure manually, use a
:ref:`GSH script <apdx-401.3.1-app-skeleton>`.


----------------
Exercise 401.3.2
----------------

*Workrooms (i.e. authorization groups) can be updated via the Board Effect
REST API.  Create Grouper authorization groups to manage those.*

A new workroom call Committee on Finance has been created in Board Effect.
Need to create authorization group in grouper and configure provisioning.

#. Create `app:boardeffect:wr_cmt_fin_authorized|allow|deny`.
#. Configure grouperESB to send membership changes to rabbitMQ exchange.

#. Write provisioner component to read rabbitMQ and update BoardEffect via REST API.

   .. note::

        This step is what logically should happen next to process the messages.
        You aren't expected to actually accomplish this step during the lab.

----------------
Exercise 401.3.3
----------------

*Board Effect account provisioning*

#. Create `app:boardeffect:boardeffect_authorized`.
#. Add `...:wr_cmt_fin_authorized` to `boardeffect_authorized_allow`.
#. Configure PSPNG to write `eduPersonEntitlement` value
   **https://college.boardeffect.com/** to LDAP and release via Shibboleth only
   for Boardeffect.

Subject to role mapping in place and provisioners working, but how do we get
reference groups for committees? Ann in President’s Office knows.

----------------
Exercise 401.3.4
----------------

*Distributed Reference Group Management*

Amy maintains list of committee members. Use these to build application specific
reference groups.

#. Create `app:boardeffect:ref:cmt_fin`.
#. Add `...:ref:cmt_fin` to `...:wr_cmt_fin_allow`.
#. Add `ref:global_deny` to `...:wr_cmt_fin_deny`.
#. Give Ann admin access to `app:boardeffect:ref` by adding account 
   **amartinez410** to `app:boardeffect:etc:boardeffect_admins`.

Log in as Ann Martinez (**amartinez410**).  Under *My Groups* you should see
the reference groups and policies Ann can manage.

----------------
Exercise 401.3.5
----------------

*Committee member helpers*

Joe Trustee is on committee, but Joe’s assistant also needs access to
committee work group.

#. Create app specific ref group `app:boardeffect:ref:cmt_fin_helpers`.
#. Add `...:cmt_fin_helpers. to `...:wr_cmt_fin_allow`.

.. note::

    By *not* adding the helper subject to `app:boardeffect:ref:cmt_fin`,
    we preserve the truth of the subject attributes.  Members of `cmt_fin`
    *are* members of the Finance Committee.  The helpers are *not* members
    of the committee, but they *are* granted access to the workroom by
    the policy.

This works great for specific assistants, but there are also general helpers
who need access to all workrooms *temporarily* during board meetings.
