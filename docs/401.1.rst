Overview
--------

VPN access is currently controlled by an LDAP group. You are not exactly sure
who is in the group or what the policy is, but have a general notion of a
natural language policy as all active faculty and staff, plus exceptions.
However, people have been added to the VPN ldap group mostly by hand over many
years with little to no lifecycle management in place. There is no easy way to
determine who should or should not be in the group. We just had a major breach
which was facilitated by access to the VPN. The compromised account used in the
breach was given to a former consultant and was never deprovisioned. CISO is
coming down hard on us to clean up our act!

----------------
Exercise 401.1.1
----------------

*Gain insight into who exactly has access to the VPN based on the cohorts found
in the legacy VPN authorization group.*

""""""""""""""""""""""
Import Legacy VPN Data
""""""""""""""""""""""

* Create a loader job from the existing ldap vpn authorization group.
* Make sure grouper group counts matches ldap group counts.
* First thing to notice is you can eyeball the types of subjects in Grouper UI.

.. note::
    For small enough groups this might be sufficient, but our VPN group has
    hundreds of subjects.

Use intersect composite groups to gain insight into types of cohorts

* `test:vpn:vpn_faculty`: Intersect `ref:faculty` with `test:vpn:vpn_legacy`.
  This yields faculty count (almost) - aha! This explains help desk calls!

* `test:vpn:vpn_employees`: Intersect `ref:staff` with `test:vpn:vpn_legacy`.
  This yields staff count (again almost!)

* `test:vpn:vpn_students`: Intersect `ref:students` with `test:vpn:vpn_legacy`.
  This yields a small count - aha!

* Totals don’t add up...so we have other cohorts too. Who are they?

* Set up composite group to filter out "other cohorts".

* `test:vpn:other_cohorts` = `...:vpn_legacy` - (`...:vpn_faculty` + 
  `...:vpn_employees` + `...:vpn_students`)

  * create `...:vpn_facstaffstudent` (include `...:vpn_faculty`,
       `...:vpn_employees`, `...:vpn_students`)
  * `...:other_cohorts` = `...:vpn_legacy` - `...:vpn_facstaffstudent`

* "Other cohorts" is a relatively small number ... can now eyeball those.

    * fac/staff that are now longer active
    * Contractors, sponsored accounts, etc
    * Others

----------------
Exercise 401.1.2
----------------

*State the natural language policy and create VPN application group and digital
policy.*

#. Natural language policy: "Faculty, staff and exceptions (some students,
   contractors, etc.)"
#. Construct `app:vpn:vpn_authorized|allow|deny` policy groups from appropriate
   reference groups.

   * `ref:faculty`
   * `ref:student`
   * `app:vpn:ref:vpn_adhoc`

#. Compare counts between ldap vpn group and `app:vpn:vpn_authorized`.
   `vpn_authorized` should be different from the legacy group in the following
   ways:

   * only active accounts
   * only current exceptions (none!)
