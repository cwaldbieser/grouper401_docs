401.2 MFA Policy Governance
===========================

-------------------
Learning Objectives
-------------------

* Use Grouper policy to control Shibboleth MFA behavior
* Create `eduPersonEntitlement` value to represent desired MFA behavior
* Evolve digital policy to match changing natural language policy

--------------
Lab Components
--------------

* Shibboleth
* Grouper
* PSPNG
* OpenLDAP
* eduPerson schema - `eduPersonEntitlement`
* REFEDS MFA profile
* `Grouper Deployment Guide <https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/Grouper/Grouper+Deployment+Guide+Work+-TIER+Program>`_

--------
Overview
--------

Your institution is deploying multi-factor authentication (MFA). The first
target application is Web SSO. Any account enabled for MFA will experience
common MFA behaviors sufficient to assert the REFEDS MFA profile during 
WebSSO authentication. The project plan calls for an initial pilot phase,
followed by a number phases where different cohorts will be required or
may opt-in. During the initial pilot phase, select cohorts will be asked to
volunteer. Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to create and evolve
the digital policy necessary to achieve the project goals.

Exercise 401.2.1
----------------

*Create initial MFA application folder set and policy in Grouper*

#. Create `app:mfa:mfa_enabled|allow|deny`.
#. Create `app:mfa:ref:pilot`.  This reference group is an access control
   list (ACL) as opposed to ABAC policy.
#. Add `app:mfa:ref:pilot` to `app:mfa:mfa_enabled_allow`.
